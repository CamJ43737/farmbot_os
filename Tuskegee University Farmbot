Good afternoon Farmbot.io! My name is Cameron Jones, student of the illustrious Tuskegee University. I am a cs major partnered with our CAENS program. As we embarked on research using our farmbot we have had a couple of issues, but we have managed to overcome them. We however have been stumped as our farmbot os had recently stopped functioning all together. In an effort to get it working again we flashed the software, following your instructions on your website. It was successful, however we cannot run any of our sequences. The farmbot will move it we instruct it to manually, but not through any of our sequences. We have also gotten errors everytime we try to run a sequence. The main one is: {:timeout, {GenServer, :call, [FarmbotOS.Firmware.UARTCore, {:start_job, %FarmbotOS.Firmware.GCode{command: :G00, echo: nil, params: [X: 1.1e3, Y: 709.8, Z: 0, A . We could use some assistance at your earliest convenience. My email is cameron.kalo@gmail.com and my number is 6156006272. Please get back to me whenever you can. Thank you.
